SRCINFO(5)
==========

Name
----
SRCINFO - Simple key-value export of PKGBUILD metadata

Description
-----------
This manual page describes the format of a .SRCINFO file found in a source
package created by makepkg. The file contains a serialized description of the
package's metadata. It is intended for reading source package metadata without
evaluating bash code, e.g. in untrusted environments or from languages other
than bash.

File format
-----------
Information is formatted in hierarchical key-value pairs separated by a '=',
one value per line. Arrays are represented by multiple keys with the same
value. Unindented keys represent a .SRCINFO section header. Keys indented with
a single tab character belong to the unindented section header preceding it.

Comments are supported by beginning a line with the hash (#) symbol.

The first section must be the 'pkgbase' key, and corresponds to the 'pkgbase'
of the source PKGBUILD. This section will contain every global
linkman:PKGBUILD[5] option or directive defined by the PKGBUILD, except for
'pkgname'.

All remaining sections must be a 'pkgname' key, and there will be one section
for each element of the PKGBUILD's pkgname array. For each element of
'pkgname', the section contents (if any) will be the split package packaging
function's overridden values for supported options and directives.
